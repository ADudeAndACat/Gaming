This repository is pretty simple: it holds various Python scripts I use for tabletop gaming of various sorts.

CRAFTING.PY -- Pathfinder crafting calculator.
DICEROLLER.PY -- Dice roll simulator.
HEALS.PY -- Currently limited to randomizing 'cure' spell results.
STATSMAKER.PY -- Currently has Pathfinder and Dungeon Crawl Classics stats generators.
